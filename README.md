# React + TypeScript + Vite \ Week 1  | DAILY 2-HOUR ROUTINE

This directory `explore-react-tailwindcss` is a testing ground to react fundamental, from understanding useState, Toggle, OnChange, and OnClick. I tried to make it 3 hours and minimum of 2 hours for daily coding routine, then do review of things by Sunday.

## Hour 1: Learn (Study + Code-Along)
- 40 min: Tutorial/Documentation
- 20 min: Code along with examples


## 📖 Study Topics:

- What is React and why use it
- Creating functional components
- JSX basics (you'll learn naturally)
- Props (passing data)
- useState hook
- Event handling (onClick, onChange)

## 📺 Resources:

- React.dev Quick Start
- FreeCodeCamp React Course (first 2 hours)

```js
//clone and run it to your local server
git clone -b explore-react-tailwindcss
npm install
```
I use heroicons for react component but it will automatically added once you run the command npm i / npm install
