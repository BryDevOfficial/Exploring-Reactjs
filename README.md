# Week 1  | DAILY 2-HOUR ROUTINE - React + TypeScript + Vite

This directory `explore-react-tailwindcss` is a testing ground to react fundamental, from understanding useState, Toggle, OnChange, and OnClick. I tried to make it 3 hours and minimum of 2 hours for daily coding routine, then do review of things by Sunday.

## Hour 1: Learn (Study + Code-Along)
- 40 min: Tutorial/Documentation
- 20 min: Code along with examples


## 📖 Study Topics:

- What is React and why use it
- Creating functional components
- JSX basics (you'll learn naturally)
- Props (passing data)
- useState hook
- Event handling (onClick, onChange)

## 📺 Resources:

- React.dev Quick Start
- FreeCodeCamp React Course (first 2 hours)

```js
//clone and run it to your local server
git clone -b explore-react-tailwindcss
npm install
```
I use heroicons for react component but it will automatically added once you run the command npm i / npm install

### Week one completed:

Due to work and time constraints during my React journey, it took me two weeks to complete this. I can now say I’m confident enough to move on to Week 2. There is still so much to explore in React, but honestly, I’ve already built full working databases back in college. My goal now is to deeply understand the fundamentals of React so I can master my LIRT Stack (Laravel, Inertia, React, Tailwind) with PostgreSQL and TypeScript.
